# DOM Events Test Site

This website is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to demonstrate and test various **DOM events**. It shows how different events are triggered by user interactions with elements on the page, and logs those events in the console. The website includes **15 common events** that can be tested interactively.

## Key Features

- **Test DOM Events**: Each event (such as `click`, `dblclick`, `mouseover`, `keydown`, `focus`, etc.) is triggered when the user interacts with an element, and the event details are logged to the console.
- **Count Events**: If an event occurs multiple times at once, it is logged once with the count of how many times it has occurred.
- **Interactive Testing**: Users can test various interactions like typing text, clicking buttons, playing a video, scrolling the page, and more.

## Events Included in the Site

Here are the 15 most common events you can test on the site:

- **`click`** - Triggered when a button is clicked.
- **`dblclick`** - Triggered when a button is double-clicked.
- **`mouseover`** - Triggered when the mouse pointer hovers over an element.
- **`mouseout`** - Triggered when the mouse pointer leaves an element.
- **`keydown`** - Triggered when a key is pressed down.
- **`keyup`** - Triggered when a key is released.
- **`input`** - Triggered when text is entered into a form field.
- **`focus`** - Triggered when an element gains focus.
- **`blur`** - Triggered when an element loses focus.
- **`submit`** - Triggered when a form is submitted.
- **`reset`** - Triggered when a form is reset.
- **`drag`** - Triggered when an element is being dragged.
- **`drop`** - Triggered when an element is dropped.
- **`touchstart`** - Triggered when the screen is touched on mobile devices.
- **`wheel`** - Triggered when the mouse wheel is scrolled.

## How to Use the Site

1. Open the site and start typing in the **input** or **textarea** fields.
2. Click, double-click, or scroll over buttons or other interactive elements.
3. As each event is triggered, it will appear in the console with details about the event and the element.
4. Try **Drag and Drop** functionality by dragging elements and dropping them in the designated drop zones.

## Requirements

- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- A JavaScript, HTML, and CSS-compatible environment.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**

## User Interface

The website provides a simple and intuitive interface to test and learn about DOM events. Users can interact with various elements on the page to see how events work in JavaScript and the DOM, helping them understand the behavior of different event types.

## Example Events

- **Text Input (`input`)**: Logs events for each character typed or changed in the input field.
- **Button Clicks (`click`, `dblclick`)**: Logs events each time a button is clicked or double-clicked.
- **Form Submit (`submit`)**: Logs events when the form is submitted or reset.
- **Page Scroll (`scroll`)**: Logs events when the page is scrolled.

## Conclusion

This site is a great tool for learning and testing **DOM events** interactively. It helps users understand how different events work in JavaScript and the DOM, improving their knowledge of web development.
